# lstm-gas-dispersion-modelling
Test of deep learning time series modelling for gas concentration prediction 

Data was generated from a digitized plot of gas concentration at a location measured by a sensor and taken
from here: https://www.aristatek.com/Newsletter/02%2007%20July/A%20Discussion%20on%20Gas%20Dispersion%20Models.htm (fig 1)

The data was then used as a basis for the LSTM model (Sci-kit Learn/Keras API was used). 

Two files can be found in the repository:
- the input data file called "8440401_image006_3"
- A Python script with the model "Gas-Dispersion-LSTM"
